📊 Sales Prediction using Linear Regression
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict sales based on advertising budgets across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels. The dataset is analyzed, visualized, and modeled using Python libraries and scikit-learn.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas & NumPy → Data manipulation

Seaborn & Matplotlib → Data visualization

Scikit-learn → Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Model Evaluation)

Google Colab → Development environment

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is advertising.csv, containing:

TV: Advertising budget spent on TV

Radio: Advertising budget spent on Radio

Newspaper: Advertising budget spent on Newspaper

Sales: Sales generated (target variable)

🚀 Workflow

Load and explore dataset

Visualize relationships using pair plots and correlation heatmap

Split dataset into train and test sets

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Predict sales for new advertising spend data

📈 Results

Model successfully predicts sales based on advertising budgets.

Performance measured using MSE on test data.

Example: Predicting sales for [TV=100, Radio=50, Newspaper=30]
